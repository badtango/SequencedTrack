# SequencedTrack
A short piece of music written entirely in Supercollider.

The aim of this patch was to try and make a structured piece of music similar to that you would make on a sequencer, only incorporating the use of algorythmic elements so that the resulting piece contains randomised events and will sound different each time it's played. Play the Demo file for example.
